# JS_GUESSING_GAME (Development in client environment)
In this project, the page will generate a random rgb color and it'll be projected on the page. The user has to guess which color represents the RGB color written above.

## The project is done with pure JavaScript.

The game is basically about guessing a color with his RGB.

When you don't guess a color, it'll fade away and the message below will cointain "Keep trying!"

Once you guess it, the color will stay and the message below will change to "Guessed!"
